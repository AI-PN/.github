# 🩺 AI for Patient Navigators

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **AI for Patient Navigators** – a healthcare-first initiative focused on making patient journeys simpler, smarter, and more supportive through AI-driven chatbots and intelligent dashboards.

## 🧠 Our Mission

Healthcare can be complex. From appointment scheduling to insurance questions and treatment follow-ups, patients often face confusion and delays. We're building AI tools that act as intelligent assistants — **empowering Patient Navigators** and helping patients get the right support at the right time.

## 💡 What We’re Building

### 1. **AI Chatbot for Healthcare Navigation**
- Context-aware, conversational AI
- Time-based and role-based access control (T-RBAC)
- Personalized, secure, and empathetic communication
- Supports multi-lingual, human-like interaction

### 2. **Patient Navigator Dashboard**
- Centralized interface for managing patient interactions
- Real-time alerts and reminders
- Integration with EHRs, calendars, and task lists
- Role-specific access for doctors, nurses, admins, and navigators

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🧭 Context-Sensitive Dialogues
- 🔐 T-RBAC: Time-Based Role Access Control
- 🧑‍⚕️ Role Switching Based on User Type (Navigator, Patient, Admin, etc.)
- 📋 Scenario-Driven Testing (e.g., missed appointments, follow-ups)
- 🗂️ Patient Summary View for Navigators
- 💬 AI Suggestions & Escalations
